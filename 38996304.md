# Bevy Commands

In Bevy systems, one of the major structs is the `Commands` struct. It allows for insertion/deletion of components and resources.

## Next Frame Wait

Commands internally use a buffer which is synchronized **only between stages**. This can lead to weird bugs:

- If one puts an entity ID into a resource which is read _before_ the next stage and acted upon, the ECS world will have no knowledge of it, as entity IDs are merely 'reserved' (read generated) upon request and only acted upon once the command buffer is cleared.
- The same counts for __resources__! A resource inserted in the same stage _cannot be requested by another system_ in the same stage, as it will not be available then.
